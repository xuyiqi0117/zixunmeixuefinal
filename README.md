# game3 Development Plan
a 2.5D survive action game build with Unity3D Project

## 0.Game Logic
- ~~player run automatically with one direction~~
- ~~player speed will increase gradually(adaptive difficulty)~~
- ~~game terrain will destroy when it leave the game zone~~
- ~~player need to ensure their body/clothes colour is as same as the tiles colour (**done check colour, need to add player destory animation**)~~
- ~~introduce score system in game (final score = suvive time + coin collected)~~
- ~~generate game terrain randomly~~
- ~~special game item (if we have time)~~
- ~~game tutorial (if we have time: **consider Fungus plugin**)~~

## 1.Research Suitable Game Source
- ~~character sprites~~
- ~~platform sprites~~
- ~~background sprites~~

## 2.Player Animation
- ~~run~~
- ~~jump (double jumple) (**current double jump is not perfect, can be better**)~~
- ~~change body/clothes colour~~

## 3.Game Tiles/Terrain Design
- ~~normal ground(the ground colour should also be accepted by color blindness)~~
- obstacles(not plan to do)
- brae(not plan to do)
- pitfall(not plan to do)

## 4.GameScene
- ~~Scene Management System~~
- ~~Pause Menu~~

## 5.Debug and build
